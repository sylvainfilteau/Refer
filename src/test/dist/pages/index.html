<h2>Class structure</h2>

<ul>

<li>Refer\Parser\ParserInterface: Defines methods that should be implemented by parsers. There should be as many parsers than file format.</li>
<li>Refer\Parser\MarkdownParser: Proxy to the Markdown&#95;Parser package</li>
<li>Refer\Parser\ParserFactory: Creates parser by filename extension</li>
<li>Refer\PageStructure\Node: Represents a directory in the structure.

<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>pages</li>
<li>childNodes</li>
</ul></li>

</ul></li>

<h3>Page structure</h3>

<p>An alternative to data source is to create a internal page structure where all the content is processed when created. The page structure is then exported to disk with an exporter.</p>

<p>There would be the same principle of tree pages as leaf and directory as node. Each pages should provide a title and a content. The difference here is that the pages are already processed, so we can guess a better title for each pages. The title should be fetched from the HTML DOM structure, in the first &lt;h1&gt; tag.</p>

<h3>Export</h3>

<p>The Export namespace enables to export PageStructure\Node to disk.</p>

<ul>
<li>Refer\Export\DirectoryExporter: Exports the page structure to disk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Themes</h2>

<p>Themes are located in pear data&#95;dir/refer/themes. Refer is currently packaged with one theme namedÂ <em>base</em>.</p>

<h3>Structure of a theme directory</h3>

<p>A theme is simply copied in the destination directory. So, a theme is simply a collection of static files used to build the page in Ajax.</p>
